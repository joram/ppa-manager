# ppa-manager
This project is to maintain those custom pesky things linux folk need to install when setting up their debian based linux environments.

## Intended Features 
- describe custom packages (package building/versioning and update detection)
- describe custom meta package (this would be for your personal dev env)
- runnable ppa server (so we can host this somewhere)

## Notes
